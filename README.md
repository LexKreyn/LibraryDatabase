## Introduction

In the program, books are displayed as a list; you can click on them to view full information; you can also delete it by clicking on the corresponding button on the right. Here, on the main screen, you have access to a line to search for books by title or author, and there is also a filter by genre.

## Quickstart

### Environment Requirements

#### Option 1: Build Env

To run the program, you'll need the following environment setup:
- Python 3.7 or higher

Creating virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activating virtual environment
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Updating PIP
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Installing modules

Please ensure all dependencies are installed.
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` listed all necessary libraries and their versions.

### Setting Up
Open `settings.py`, make changes by selecting the database type and editing the data to connect to it. For SQLite, you do not need to set up a connection, just enter a name.

```python
DB_TYPE = DBType.SQLITE

DB_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
DB_USER = 'library_user'
DB_PASS = 'library_pass'
DB_NAME = 'library'
```

## Launching

Now you can run the program by running file main.py, or via the console:
```bash
python main.py
```
